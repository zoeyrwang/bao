    <h2>Sonya Duggal: Competition Director</h2>
    <p>Sonya is an aspiring and goal-oriented freshman with a strong background in both the liberal arts and sciences. She has strong initiative and is a very driven individual that works hard in every field she encounters and there is no problem that can stunt her. She won 5th place in the Science Olympiad event Anatomy & Physiology at the New York state competition, the harvest of her months of hard work and dedication. Sonya is also the founder of the EcoVoices zine, a student-run magazine that accepts submissions from middle and high school students, with alternating seasonal themes to raise awareness about climate change and the impending environmental disasters the Earth suffers from. Even with all her extracurriculars, she is a splendidly stellar high school student as well and never ceases to amaze and perform well on tests, quizzes, and any exam in any course, a true role model to all aspiring students.
